##Data##
- Users
 - Look at the Kaggle script to gain more insight to the dataset
- Sessions
 - More than 1 million rows of session data 

##Techniques##
- XGBOOST
 - Looks as though the parameters have been tweaked
- Clustering 
 - Group similar users together? See what the prediction rate is like for a certain group of users
 - Data size may not be suitable though

##Feature generation##
 - Sessions
  - Number of sessions
  - Average duration of each session
  - Stuff that they looked at during each session, maybe come up with a ranking
